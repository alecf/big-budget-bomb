## Testing and Development Guidelines

### Build Process
- **ALWAYS** run `npm build` to test the application
- **NEVER** start the development server (`npm run dev`) when testing functionality
- Use the build process to validate that the code compiles and works correctly
- The build command will catch TypeScript errors, linting issues, and other problems

### Commands to Use
- ✅ `npm build` - Use this to test the app
- ✅ `npm run build` - Alternative build command  
- ✅ `npm run lint` - For linting checks
- ❌ `npm run dev` - Do NOT use this for testing
- ❌ `npm run start` - Do NOT use this for testing

### Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Run `npm build` to validate changes
3. Fix any build errors before proceeding
4. Only suggest starting the dev server if explicitly requested by the user

### Rationale
- Building the app ensures production-ready code
- Catches compilation errors early
- Validates the entire application without running a server
- More reliable for testing code changes in an automated environment
